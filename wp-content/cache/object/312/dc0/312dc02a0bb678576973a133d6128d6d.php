Monero, a privacy-centric currency, trails 10th place IOTA, which has a market cap of more than $4 billion.
<h2>Recovering $1 Billion</h2>
Monero has gained $1 billion this week, having begun the week at $167.78 with a market capitalization of $2.66 billion.

The cryptocurrency has almost recovered the capitalization it gave up over the past month; the price reached $233.53 on March 21 with a market cap of $3.732 billion. It still has a way to go, however, to reclaim the $389.03 price on Jan. 20, when its market cap topped $6.078 billion.

The price remains well above the $40 to $50 range it was in last year. Monero was among a host of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, that allowed the market to climb to $334 billion, eyeing a move to $350 billion. Bitcoin rebounded to $8,100 over the past 24 hours after it dropped to $7,850 on April 17.
<h2>Hard Fork Brings Improvement</h2>
<a href="https://www.ccn.com/monero-hard-forks-to-maintain-asic-resistance-but-classic-hopes-to-spoil-the-party/">Monero activated its semi-annual hard fork on April 6</a>, bringing a host of new upgrades. One particular Monero upgrade, though, threatens to split the network into two competing chains.

Monero earlier this year announced its intention toÂ <a href="https://www.ccn.com/monero-sticks-to-anti-asic-guns-with-emergency-software-update/">update its instance of the Cryptonight Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining algorithm</a>Â at regular intervals to prevent mining hardware manufacturers from developing Monero-compatible Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners, as critics allege that these devices lead to mining centralization and threaten the networkâ€™s health.

ASIC chips maximize efficiency to such an extent that it becomes no longer profitable to mine with GPU miners, whose chips are general-purpose and use for everything from PC gaming to searching for extraterrestrial life.

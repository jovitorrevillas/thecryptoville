Emmanuel Duterte first established his Japan-Philippines Global Coin platform in January this year, with backing from financial investors from both the Philippines and Japan. The company has filed an application for an operating license with the countryâ€™s regulatory Securities and Exchanges Commission, which has so far issued licenses to two platforms: Rebittance and Betur.

In an interview, Emmanuel Duterte said he was approached with the idea of setting up a Japanese-Filipino platform by Japanese residents in the Philippine city of Cebu â€“ a popular resort destination for South Korean, Japanese and Chinese tourists.

â€œThe cryptocurrency platform offers convenience. It lets cryptocurrency wallet holders pay in stores abroad using their smartphones," said Emmanuel Duterte.

A rival Filipino-Japanese crypto-pay platform, developed by Manila-based Satoshi Citadel Industries, was unveiled in March this year. The company, whose financial backers include South Koreaâ€™s Kakao Group, also issued an Initial Coin Offering earlier this year.

Satoshi Citadel Industries claims Japanese tourists can now use its Noah Coin tokens to settle their bills at the Dakak beach resort in the southern Philippines, and expects further remittance developments later this year. The company claims that Filipinos in Japan, meanwhile, will be able to transfer money abroad with fees of around 2-3% on transactions worth around USD 550.";s:10:"post_title";s:71:"Exchange Run by Philippine Presidentâ€™s Brother Seeks Operating Permit";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:68:"exchange-run-by-philippine-presidents-brother-seeks-operating-permit";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-05-10 02:33:15";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-05-10 02:33:15";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:38:"http://localhost/thecryptoville/?p=668";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
